# Website-for-Centre-Ahli-Volunteer-Work

A website for “Centre Ahli”, a center that welcomes boys in precarious situations whose ages vary between 7 and 15 years.
The website is still under construction and is not available for the public right now.

Software:

The goals of this website were:

• To present the center to the public in a positive way.

• To be international by using English, Arabic and French as the supported languages since a lot of the volunteers that come to the center to help are non-Moroccans.

• To automate some tasks that are performed daily by the educators, such as:

- Organizing activities with the children.
- Adding children to those activities.
- Subscribing volunteers to those activities.

To store information, I used a database and handled it using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. To program I used Visual Studio which allows using all of the technologies needed in one program.
